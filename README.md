# oh-my-ladder : Awesome Configuration Generator for Ladders

I use different network proxy App in different device to help me visit the "world wide web". I use the Surge App on iOS while SSH Proxy on macOS. My friend even use Potatso as an alternative of Surge.

These days I am tired of keep configuration of all these Apps sync. So, that's what *oh-my-ladder* stands for.

oh-my-ladder is a configuration generator with plugin architecture, so both developer and user can get benefit from it.
